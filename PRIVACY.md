# Privacy Policy

Remonline Client Helper (unofficial) is a Chrome extension that runs only on
https://web.roapp.io/*.

## Data We Collect
We do not collect, store, sell, or transmit any personal data or browsing data.

## Data We Access
The extension reads order numbers on web.roapp.io to build a client link and
modifies the page UI by hiding the "Actions" button.

## Storage
We store only one user setting: the base URL used to build client links. This
value is saved in chrome.storage.sync.

## Third Parties
No data is sent to third parties by the extension. When a user clicks the
client link, the browser navigates to the configured base URL.

## Contact
If you have questions, contact: ai_kolesnik@mail.ru
